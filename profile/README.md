## Hey ðŸ‘‹

We are setup.md and our goal is to provide the Minecraft community with a single point of reference for all the documentation that is required when it comes to server administration. This will forever be a continual project and will most likely out live the original authors / contributors as changes in the game further down the line  may outdate some of the information presented.

Over the course of the next 12 months the setup.md contributors will be focusing on the following:

- Deploying a server
- Hosting the server with dedicated providers
- Troubleshooting the server with common errors
- Enhancing that server with plugins / mods
- Further expansions to a server which and completely change the setup
